## 🤝 Keeping It Conflict-Free {Syncing Your Fork}

Stay updated and conflict-free with the latest code from the main repo. Here’s how to keep your fork in sync:

1. **Add the Main Repo as Upstream:**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/club-gamma-backend.git
   ```

2. **Verify the Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Sync It Up:**
   - Pull in the latest and merge it:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. **Stay Fresh:**
   - Regularly sync with upstream to avoid any merge madness. 🌀
